I'm interested in fluid mechanics, CFD simulations, designing engineering systems, and optimizing performance in various applications, including **aerodynamics**, **wind tunnel testing**, and **mechanical systems**.

ðŸŒ± **Current Projects**:
- Lithium-Ion Battery Thermal Management (Simulation and optimization in ANSYS Fluent).
- Wind Tunnel Testing and Controls Engineering (Arduino-based drag and lift measurement system).
- Stress and Failure Analysis (OceanGate Titan submersible).

ðŸ“š **Research Interests**:
- CFD applications in aerodynamics and thermal management.
- Drag reduction over bluff bodies.
- Exploring innovative cooling solutions for battery systems and other energy storage technologies.

ðŸ’¼ **Letâ€™s Collaborate**:
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **CFD projects**, **aerodynamic simulations**, and **material-related projects** for real-world engineering applications.
