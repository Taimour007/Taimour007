ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Taimour Zahid ðŸŒŸ
I'm passionate about fluid mechanics, CFD simulations, biomimetics, and designing engineering systems. I focus on optimizing performance in various applications, such as aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing, biomimetic design, and mechanical systems.

ðŸŒ± Current Projects:

Lithium-Ion Battery Thermal Management (Simulation and optimization in ANSYS Fluent).

Wind Tunnel Testing and Controls Engineering (Arduino-based drag and lift measurement system).

Stress and Failure Analysis (OceanGate Titan submersible).

Bat-Inspired Agile Flying Robot (Biomimetic design integrated with CFD for enhanced aerodynamic performance).

ðŸ“š Research Interests:

CFD applications in aerodynamics, thermal management, and fluid-structure interaction.

Biomimetic design and its applications in engineering, focusing on natural flight dynamics and structural optimization.

Drag reduction over bluff bodies and enhancing efficiency through innovative surface modifications.

Exploring innovative cooling solutions for battery systems and other energy storage technologies.

ðŸ’¼ Letâ€™s Collaborate:
Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on CFD projects, biomimetics, aerodynamic simulations, and material-related projects for real-world engineering applications.
