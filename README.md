👋 Hi, I’m @Taimour007
👀 I’m interested in fluid mechanics, CFD simulations, designing engineering systems, and optimizing performance in various applications, including aerodynamics, wind tunnel testing, and mechanical systems.
🌱 I’m currently working on projects related to thermal optimization, battery cooling systems, and wind tunnel testing using ANSYS Fluent, CATIA, and Arduino.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on CFD projects, aerodynamic simulations, and material related projeccts for real-world engineering applications.

⚡ Fun fact: Spent an entire weekend optimizing a cooling system for a battery—only to find out it was already perfect.
📚 Current Projects:
-Lithium-Ion Battery Thermal Management (Simulation and optimization in ANSYS Fluent).
-Wind Tunnel Testing and Controls Engineering (Arduino-based drag and lift measurement system).
-Stress and Failure Analysis (OceanGate Titan submersible).
🔭 Research Interests:
-CFD applications in aerodynamics and thermal management.
-Drag Reduction over bluff bodies.
-Exploring innovative cooling solutions for battery systems and other energy storage technologies.
